This is favourable for jobseekers, as job opportunities are greater and competition between applicants is reduced. Inversely, as the Index falls, it demonstrates a 'softening' employment market (i.e.supply outweighs demand) and advertisers find it easier to fill roles. In this instance, jobseekers need tocompete for the available jobs. It was developed in consultation with Victoria University's Centre of Strategic Economic Studies.
